==  WIS2 to GTS Gateway

The Executive Council, with resolution 34 (EC-76), endorsed the WMO Information System 2.0 (WIS2) implementation plan and recognized the importance of establishing a pilot phase to develop the WIS2 infrastructure and begin testing it in order to be ready for a preoperational phase in 2024, and then for the transition starting on 2025. According to the WIS2 implementation plan, the Global Telecommunication System (GTS) will be decommissioned after 2030, and National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs) will use the WIS2 platform for data exchange.

During the transition period, in order to avoid some WIS centres being forced to run both data sharing frameworks simultaneously for WIS2 and GTS, with the challenges associated with maintaining two operational systems for the same purpose, a gateway from WIS2 to GTS has been designed, taking into account the time required for Members to migrate to the new systems and minimizing the time a member must operate both systems in parallel.

It must be noted, that a centre currently sending and receiving data on the GTS will have two options:
- running in parallel a Message Switching System to send and receive data on the GTS **and** a WIS2 Node to send and receive data on WIS2
- relying solely on a WIS2 Node to send and receive data. In this situation, the centre will benefit from the GTS to WIS2 gateway service to continue getting data from centres on the GTS that have not yet implemented of WIS2 Node. The centre must contribute to the WIS2 to GTS gateway service by complying to the Technical requirements below.

=== Purpose

The purpose of this gateway is to enable GTS members who have not yet migrated to WIS2 to continue to receive GTS data from GTS members who have migrated to WIS2 and stopped their GTS systems.

**Note**: Only data that have been already published in GTS (therefore having a TTAAii and CCCC) are concerned by this gateway. New data (that is data currently not available on the GTS) will be available **only** on WIS2. 

=== WIS2 to GTS Gateway provider

The gateway will be provided by volunteering centers, typically some Regional Telecommunication Hubs (RTH). 

=== Technical requirements - for the data producers

To enable the Gateway, providers to do the mapping from WIS2 to GTS, and data providers shall include in the WIS2 Notification Message (WNM) a GTS property as follows:
